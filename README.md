StarMap
=======

Java-based Stellarium clone for CSC421 GUI/OOP

#Usage
Viewing
By default, the star map will show the stars at (0, 0) at the current date. You can pan around the visible stars by dragging with the mouse, and zoom with the scroll wheel. If you hover the mouse over a star, a box will appear in the top-right of the screen describing the star.

Set Position
Press View->Set Position/Date to open a dialog which will let you modify your current viewing position, angle, and date. The map will be updated when you press OK.

Find Star
Press View->Find Star/Constellation to open a dialog that lets you enter the name of an object. If the name matches the name or common name of a star, or name of a constellation (ignoring case), the map will zoom in on that star or constellation.

Constellations
By default, the lines and names of constellations will appear around their stars. Press View->Show Constellations to toggle these on and off.
